# sc

Package sc provides a way to interface directly with the
SuperCollider server from Go programs.

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/scgolang/sc)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/scgolang/sc)

## Why

SuperCollider has a well-deserved reputation for being difficult
to learn. I believe that sclang is a big reason for this.
I also believe that Go is quite easy to learn, hence
replacing sclang with Go makes a lot of sense to me.
