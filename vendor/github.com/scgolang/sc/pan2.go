// Pan2 is a two-channel equal power panner.
// It takes the square root of the linear scaling factor going from 1 (left or right)
// to 0.5.sqrt (~=0.707) in the center, which is about 3dB reduction.
// With linear panning (LinPan2) the signal is lowered as it approaches center
// using a straight line from 1 (left or right) to 0.5 (center) for a 6dB reduction
// in the middle. A problem inherent to linear panning is that the perceived volume
// of the signal drops in the middle. Pan2 solves this.
